# Postfix Evaluators

I got bored and decided I'd be implementing postfix evaluators for various languages. I cannot recall why I felt like doing this, but it's being done. I plan on doing it in every langauge that I've implemented the "Dining Philosophers" problem in. See [that project](https://github.com/jackjohn7/dining_philosophers) to view that list.

At the moment, only Go has been implemented. What a great language.
